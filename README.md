# Aid Explorer

- Link: http://aidxp.cid-labs.com/
- The person who knows the most about the Aid Explorer code is Michele Coscia.
- The deployment code is in the old ansible deploy scripts: https://github.com/cid-harvard/atlas-playbooks/blob/master/roles/aidxp/tasks/main.yml
- It's hosted on EC2 - perhaps it could be moved to Elastic Beanstalk to make maintenance a bit more easy, and we can move the ansible script to be an .ebextensions one.
